# interest api
---
This go program scrapes data from facebook and creates an api for analyzing what people are interested in.

The technical definition for the term interest in this project is a noun with a wikipedia page, that someone is posting about.

A future goal is to be able to compare interests with occupations, skills, or location. But for now, only interest vs. interest comparisons are available.
